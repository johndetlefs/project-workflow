## User Story

As a Codex user, I want the public 0.4.0 package independently verified so that project upgrades use the actual released Delegate-capable artifact.

## Parent AC Coverage

- AC4

## Child Charter

### Inherited Invariants

- The reviewed source, tag, wheel, source distribution, release assets, and public package are traceable to one 0.4.0 release identity.
- Historical completed-task evidence is not rewritten to simulate current version alignment.
- Consumer user-owned files and unrelated Git changes are preserved.
- Only canonical project authority roots are upgraded; workspace child repositories do not gain duplicate workflow state.
- No consumer project is called upgraded if it is blocked, partially mutated, or not validated.

### Invalid Substitutes

- A green source test suite without exact built/public artifact checks.
- A tag or GitHub Release without PyPI publication and fresh installation proof.
- A saved Codex project name without a canonical root manifest.
- A source-checkout upgrade, copied managed files, or an unreviewed nested workflow copy in place of public-package upgrade.
- A successful upgrade command without scoped diff and Doctor validation.

### Artifact Targets

- PyPI `project-workflow==0.4.0`.
- GitHub Release `v0.4.0` with wheel, source distribution, hashes/provenance, and release notes.
- A clean, validated Project Workflow `main` lineage.
- Per-project installed 0.4.0 managed assets for every eligible Codex project.
- Parent release/rollout receipt and acceptance audit.

### Parent AC Proof Ownership

- AC4: owner `TASK-066`; required evidence: Fresh public install, public artifact hashes, attestation/provenance

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: Fresh public installation, version/Delegate inspection, public hashes, and attestation verification all pass.

## Validation

- AC1 / parent AC4: fresh public UVX journey, downloaded asset digests, and GitHub attestation output.

## Repository Evidence

## Parent AC Evidence

- AC4: Pending implementation evidence. Recipe-triggered claims must also be backed by `EVIDENCE.json`.
